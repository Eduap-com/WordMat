<h1><a >Math Fields (Equation Editor)</a></h1>

<p>The built-in equation editor in Word is really good because
you can very quickly create mathematical expressions that look very nice. To
get the full potential out of it, it is important that you learn the shortcuts
that are built into it, so you do not have to click in the menu all the time.
All mathematics can be entered with the keyboard.</p>

<p>You insert a new math field with the shortcut <b>Alt + M </b><br>
(Without WordMath, the shortcut is <b>Alt + =</b>, but it is somewhat more
difficult)</p>

<p>When you type in a mathematics field, it is continuously
transformed into a 'professional layout', where it looks like mathematics as
you would write it on paper. The conversion is often automatic, but typically
needs to be activated by pressing the space bar right after the expression.
Examples:</p>

<p>2/3             Space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;      
 \(\frac{2}{3}\) </span></p>

<p>2^3             Space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;      
 \(2^{3}\) </span></p>

<p>x_1             Space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;      
 \(x_{1}\) </span></p>

<p>There are also special key shortcuts for mathematical
symbols. They all start with the symbol backslash '\', i.e. a backslash. On
Windows computers, you typically enter backslash by pressing 'alt-gr' (just to
the right of the space bar) along with the button that is just to the left of
z. On Mac computers, enter backslash with <b>Option + shift + 7</b> (shift + 7
gives the normal slash).</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>\pi          Space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;  
 \(\pi \) </span></p>

<p>\sqrt       Space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;     
 \(\sqrt{}\) </span>space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;   \(\sqrt{}\)
</span></p>

<p>Notice here how two spaces can sometimes turn a symbol into
a 'template' that you can fill in. </p>

<p>To make a fraction, it's easiest to just type in a regular
slash followed by a space.</p>

<p>/           Space <span style='font-family:Consolas'>&#8594;  
 \(\frac{\Box}{\Box}\) </span></p>

<p>Then you can use the arrow keys to navigate into the
fraction template and fill in the numerator and denominator.</p>

<p>These templates can be an advantage to use, as you avoid
having to write parentheses.</p>

<p>In the WordMath menu on the right side, there is a button
called 'Shortcuts'. It shows an overview of the keyboard shortcuts for WordMath
and the most commonly used shortcuts for the math fields. You can also see
these overviews on the following pages.</p>

clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
