# Shared

The share folder holds files which are uses in both the Windows and Mac version. The two installers grab the files from here.

Actually many files are in both versions, but must be copied from Windows to Mac, when they are changed and require a bit of tweaking.
Mainly because special characters can mess up in many files when they are opened on a Mac.

## Fonts
This folder holds math-fonts which are installed into Word.
The fonts are used to create documents that are similar to Latex-documents

## Maxima-files
Files that are added to the original Maxima installation or changes

## Translations
Excel sheet to translate WordMat

## WordDocs
Different Worddocuments used in WordMat
Word documents that contain code must be kept separately between Windows and Mac

## WordMat-Ribbon
The ribbon is in the WordMat.dotm file. This folder folds icons used in the ribbon in case they mess up.

## Testing
Files used to test WordMat before a new release
