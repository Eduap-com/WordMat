# Translations
The file *Translations.xlsm* holds most of the text in WordMat translated to English, Spanish and Danish
It has a builtin macro which can generate code for WordMat.dotm class module CSprog.
If more people want to translate this is where it starts.

Not all text is in this file though. Some of the original text was implemented in another way and requires more handling.
