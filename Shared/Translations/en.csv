673#£Calculating
674#£I'm calculating
675#£This method requires an interval where a solution is within the interval. Only one solution must be in the interval. Look at the graph to indentify the solutions.
676#£About interval method
677#£Newton-Raphson method requires an inital guess at a solution. The method is not guaranteed to find a solution if there is one.Only 1 solution is found. Look at the graph to identify an initial guess.
678#£About Newton-Raphson
679#£You must save your document before Backup can be perfomed!
680#£Do NOT edit this document or close or it. WordMat needs it for calculations. Anything you enter here will be deleted.
681#£Problems with the file 'normal.dotm', can cause problems with keyboard shortcuts in WordMat. The problems can be resolved by deleting the file, since a new default file is automatically generated when Word restarts. The file cannot be deleted while Word is open. You must do it manually.\r\n\r\n- Press OK to open the folder where Normal.dotm is located. \r\n- Save your Work and close Word \r\n- delete normal.dotm \r\n- Open Word and open and close WordMat settings
