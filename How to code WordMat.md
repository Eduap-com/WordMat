# How to code WordMat

## Intro
This document describes the structure of the WordMat code and how to go about changing or adding to the code.

## WordMat.dotm
Holds the main code as Visual Basic for Application (VBA) code.
Word documents can have macros (VBA code) attached to the document. Word documents with VBA code have the extension .dotm or .dotx in stead of .docx.
Since the WordMat.dotm file is a Word template double clicking the file will create a copy of the original file, to edit the original file right click and open.
Once the file is open you can click Alt+F11 to open the Visual Basic development Environment (VBE).
You can also go to **Files | settings | Customize ribbon** and put a checkmark next to developer. Which will add a new menu to the ribbon in Word, where you can also open the VBE by clicking *Visual Basic*.
From this menu you can also launch macros (VBA functions). You can also launch Macros by pressing alt+F8.

### SolveReal.mac
When you want to change this code the best approach is the paste it all into WxMaxima, where you can test the functions, and make changes. When done copy/paste back to the .mac file.
