== C library package == 

The C library package consists of
- the library's C source (directory lib/),
- test code (directory test/),
- manual pages (directory man/),
- build utilities (aclocal.m4, build-aux/, config*, m4/, Makefile*).

Installation requires a recent C compiler that supports the C99 standard.
Otherwise, the library is self-contained, and installation should be
straightforward, using the usual command sequence

./configure
make
sudo make install

The command ./configure takes various options that are explained in the
file INSTALL.

Please report bugs to the package maintainer.

== Language bindings ==

The C library libcerf can be wrapped for use with other programming languages.
Such language bindings are added to the libcerf package as contributed by
their authors.

The following bindings are available:
