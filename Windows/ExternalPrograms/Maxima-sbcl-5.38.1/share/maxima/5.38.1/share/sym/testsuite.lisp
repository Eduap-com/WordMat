;;; The Maxima test suite is defined to be the sum of all the tests
;;; in the files listed in *testsuite-files*.
;;; Each entry can either be a plain file name (minus extension), e.g.,
;;; "testfile.mac", or a list containing a file name followed by the numbers
;;; of the test problems that are expected to fail, e.g.
;;; ("testfile.mac" 7 9 13).
