The COMA Control Engineering package currently comprises:
* Inverse Laplace-transform of transfer functions of arbitrary order
* Unit step responses
* Nyquist diagrams and Bode plots
* Poles and Zeros, root locus plots
* Stability investigations: stability limit, Hurwitz criterion, stable regions in the parameter plane, phase margin, gain margin
* Optimization and controller design: ISE-criterion (integral of squared error), gain optimum
* State space methods: Conversion into a transfer function, canonical forms, controllability, observability
