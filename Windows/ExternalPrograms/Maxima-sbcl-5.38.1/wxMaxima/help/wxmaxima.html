<h2 class="unnumbered">The wxMaxima user's manual</h2>

<p>wxMaxima is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Maxima computer
algebra system (CAS). wxMaxima allows to use all of Maxima's
functions. In addition, it  provides convenient wizards for accessing
the most commonly used features. This manual describes some of the
features that make wxMaxima one of the most popular GUIs for Maxima.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction to wxMaxima</h2>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Maxima and wxMaxima</h3>

<p>In the open-source domain big systems are normally split into smaller
projects that are easier to handle for small groups of developers. 
For example a CD burner program will consist of a command-line tool
that actually burns the CD and a graphical user interface that allows
users to use it without having to learn about all the command line
switches and in fact without using the commandline at all. One
advantage of this approach is that the developing work that
was invested into the command-line program can be shared by many
programs without having to re-invent the wheel: The same CD-burner
command-line program can be used as a &ldquo;send-to-CD&rdquo;-plug-in for a
file manager application, for the &ldquo;burn to CD&rdquo; function of a music
player and as the CD writer for a DVD backup tool. Another advantage
is that splitting one big task into smaller parts allows the
developers to provide several user interfaces for the same program.

   <p>Computer algebra systems like Maxima fit into this framework. A CAS can provide
the logic behind a arbitrary precision calculator
application or it can do automatic transforms of formulas in the
background of a bigger system (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a>). Alternatively, it can be a
actually used as a free-standing system. Maxima can be accessed via a
command line. Often, however, an interface like wxMaxima proves a more
efficient way to access the software, especially for newcomers. 
computer algebra system.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 Maxima</h4>

<p><a name="index-CAS-1"></a><a name="index-Computer-algebra-System-2"></a>Maxima
is a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS). In other
words it is a program that can solve mathematical problems by
rearranging formulas and finding a formula that solves the problem as
opposed to just outputting the numeric value of the result. In other words,
Maxima can serve as a calculator that gives numerical representations of variables,
but it can also provide analytical solutions. Furthermore, it offers a range of
numerical methods of analysis for equations or systems of equations that cannot
be solved analytically.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="maxima_screenshot.jpg" alt="maxima_screenshot.jpg"></div>

   <p>Extensive documentation for Maxima is available on the internet,

   <p>There is extensive documentation for maxima
<a href="href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/documentation.html">available in the internet</a>

   <p>part of this documentation is also available in wxMaxima's help menu:
Pressing the &lt;Help&gt; key (on most systems that would be the
&lt;F1&gt; key) wxmaxima's context-sensitive help feature
will automatically jump to maxima's manual page for the command at the
cursor.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 wxMaxima</h4>

<p>wxMaxima is a graphical user interface that provides the full
functionality and flexibility of Maxima.  wxMaxima offers users a
graphical display and many features that make working with Maxima
easier. For example wxMaxima allows one to export any cell's contents (or,
if that is needed, any part of a formula, as well) as text, as LaTeX
or as MathML specification at a simple right-click. Indeed, an entire
workbook can be exported, either as an HTML file or as a LaTeX file.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="wxMaximaWindow.jpg" alt="wxMaximaWindow.jpg"></div>

   <p>The calculations are performed by the Maxima command-line tool in the
background.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Worksheet basics</h3>

<p>Much of wxMaxima is self-explaining, but some details require
attention. <a href="http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/help.html">This site</a>
contains a number of workbooks that address various aspects of
Maxima. Working through some of these (particularly the "10 minute (wx)Maxima tutorial") will
increase one's familiarity with both the content of Maxima and the use of wxMaxima to interact
with Maxima. This manual concentrates on describing aspects of wxMaxima that are not likely
to be self-evident and that might not be covered in the online material.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 The worksheet approach</h4>

<p>One of the very few things that aren't standard is that wxMaxima
organizes the data for Maxima into cells that are only evaluated (which
means: sent to Maxima) when the user requests this. When a cell is evaluated,
all commands in that cell, and only that cell, are evaluated as a batch. (One can
select a set of adjacent cells and evaluate them together. Also, one can instruct
Maxima to evaluate all cells in a workbook in one pass.) This approach might
feel unfamiliar at the first sight. It does, however drastically ease work with
big documents (where the user certainly does not want every small change
to automatically to trigger a full re-evaluation of the whole
document). Also, this approach is very handy for debugging.

   <p>The cells wxMaxima automatically creates on typing some text are Maxima
input cells that will eventually be sent to Maxima.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="InputCell.jpg" alt="InputCell.jpg"></div>

   <p>On evaluation of an input cell's contents the input cell maxima
assigns a label to the input (by default shown in red and recognizable
by the <code>%i</code>) by which it can be referenced later n the wxMaxima
session. The output that Maxima generates will be shown in a different
style  (which can be
user-selected) and preceded by a Maxima label that begins  beginning
with <code>%o</code>. The output item can be accessed later with a reference
to this code. By default wxMaxima will also attempt to replace this
dynamically-generated label by a more descriptive name if the user
provides one. The <code>%o</code>-style label Maxima auto-generates will
still be accessible, though.

   <p>Besides the input cells wxMaxima allows for text cells for
documentation, image cells, title cells, chapter
cells and section cells. Every cell has it's own undo buffer so debugging
by changing the values of several cells and then gradually reverting the
unneeded changes is rather easy. Furthermore the worksheet itself has a
global undo buffer that can undo cell edits, adds and deletes.

   <p>The figure below shows a title cell, a section cell, a text cell, and part of an
input/output cell.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="NoiseFilter.jpg" alt="NoiseFilter.jpg"></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.2 Cells</h4>

<p>The worksheet is organized in cells that work like very much like the
styles word processors offer. Each cell can contain one of the following
types of content:
     <ul>
<li>one or more lines of maxima input
<li>an image
<li>a title, section or a subsection
<li>Output of or a question from maxima
<li>normal a text block that can for example used for explaining the meaning
      of the math cell's contents. 
</ul>
   The default behavior of wxMaxima when text is input is to automatically
create a math cell. Cells of other types can be created
using the Cell menu or using the hotkeys shown in the menu.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.3 Horizontal and vertical cursors</h4>

<p>It sometimes is desirable to allow selecting multiple cells or
only part of a cell for export or Drag-and-Drop. 
However, beginning such an action
in the middle of one cell and ending it in the middle of another will
almost certainly lead to unexpected results. wxMaxima
will therefore extend the selection to full cells in this case.

   <p>wxMaxima works around this by defining two types of cursors wxMaxima
will switch between automatically when needed:
     <ul>
<li>A horizontal cursor that is able to select any number of whole
      cells. This cursor is activated by moving the cursor between
      two cells or by clicking on a space between two cells. 
      To select a set of adjacent cells, click in the bracket at the
      left of the top cell (but not in the triangle) and then drag the
      cursor so that this cell and the next cell (or range of cells)
      is highlighted. Then use &lt;ctrl+enter&gt; or &lt;shift+enter&gt;
      to execute the highlighted cells.

     <li>A vertical cursor that works inside a cell. This cursor is
      activated by moving the cursor inside a cell using the mouse
      pointer or the cursor keys. 
</ul>
   As long as the cursor is inside a cell search operations will limit
their scope to the current cell.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.4 Command autocompletion</h4>

<p>wxMaxima contains an autocompletion feature that is triggered via the menu
(Cell/Complete Word) or alternatively by pressing the key combination
&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;k&gt;. The autocompletion is context-sensitive and if activated
within an unit specification for ezUnits it will offer a list of applicable
units.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="ezUnits.png" alt="ezUnits.png"></div>

   <p>Besides completing the current command's or variable's name the
autocompletion is able to show a template for most of the
commands indicating the type (and meaning) of the parameters this
program expects. To activate this feature press
&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;k&gt; or select the respective menu item
(Cell/Show Template).

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.5 Greek characters</h4>

<p>Computers traditionally store characters in 8-bit values. This allows
for a maximum of 256 different characters. All letters, numbers,
and control symbols (end of transmission, end of string, lines and
edges for drawing rectangles for menus etc.) of nearly any given
language can fit within that limit.

   <p>For most countries the codepage of 256 characters that has been chosen
does not include Greek letters, though. To overcome this limitation
unicode has been invented: This is a method of including characters
that are not normally used in the English language in a text that
(as long as only the basic form of Latin characters is used)
looks like plain 8-bit ASCII.

   <p>Maxima allows for unicode characters if it runs on a lisp that
supports them. If the wxWidgets library that wxMaxima is built on
supports unicode characters, too, then wxMaxima can be built with unicode
support. In this case it (besides a Greek Characters Sidebar) provides
a method of entering Greek characters using the keyboard:
     <ul>
<li>An alpha is entered by pressing the &lt;ESC&gt; key and then typing in
      the character a followed by a press on the &lt;ESC&gt; key. 
<li>A beta is entered by pressing the &lt;ESC&gt; key and then typing in
      the character b followed by a press on the &lt;ESC&gt; key. 
<li>A gamma is entered by pressing the &lt;ESC&gt; key and then typing in
      the character c followed by a press on the &lt;ESC&gt; key. 
<li>...and so on. 
</ul>
   If the system does not provide unicode support wxMaxima will still
provide a method of showing greek characters: Variable names like
"alpha" are always displayed as the corresponding greek symbols.

   <p>The lowercase greek letters actually can be entered both by enter
a lating letter or the whole latin name of the greek letter
followed and preceded by a press of the escape key:
<pre class="example">     a alpha    i iota      r rho
     b beta     k kappa     s sigma
     g gamma    l lambda    t tau
     d delta    m mu        u upsilon
     e epsilon  n nu        f phi
     z zeta     x xi        c chi
     h eta      om omicron  y psi
     q theta    p pi        o omega
</pre>
   <p>The same is true for the uppercase greek letters:
<pre class="example">     A Alpha    I Iota      R Rho
     B Beta     K Kappa     S Sigma
     G Gamma    L Lambda    T Tau
     D Delta    M Mu        U Upsilon
     E Epsilon  N Nu        P Phi
     Z Zeta     X Xi        C Chi
     H Eta      Om Omicron  Y Psi
     T Theta    P Pi        O Omega
</pre>
   <p>This mechanism also allows to enter some miscellaneous mathematical
symbols:
<pre class="example">     hbar          planck's constant: a h with a vertical bar above it
     Hbar          a H with a vertical bar above it
</pre>
   <p>This mechanism also allows to enter some miscellaneous mathematical
symbols:
<pre class="example">     2             squared
     3             to the power of three
     /2            1/2
     partial       partial sign (the d of dx/dt)
     integral      integral sign
     sq            root
     ii            imaginary
     ee            element
     hb or hbar    h barred
     Hbar          H barred
     in            in
     impl,implies  implies
     inf           infinity
     empty         empty
     TB            Big triangle right
     tb            small triangle right
     and           and
     or            or
     xor           xor
     nand          nand
     nor           nor
     equiv         equivalent
     not           not
     union         union
     inter         intersection
     subseteq      subset or equal
     subset        subset
     notsubseteq   not subset or equal
     notsubset     not subset
     approx        approximately
     propto        proportional to
     neq,!=,/=
     or #          not equal to
     +/- or pm     a plus/minus sign
     &lt;= or leq     equal or less than
     &gt;= or geq     equal or greater than
     &lt;&lt; or ll      much less than
     &gt;&gt; or gg      much greater than
     equiv         equivalent to
     qed           end of proof
     sum           sum sign
     prod          product sign
     exists        "there exists" sign
     nexists       "there is no" sign
     parallel      a "parallel" sign
     perp          a "perpendicular" sign
     leadsto       a "leads to" sign
     -&gt;            a right arrow
</pre>
   <p>If a special symbol isn't in the list it is possible to input arbitrary
unicode characters by pressing <code>&lt;ESC&gt;number of the character&lt;ESC&gt;</code>. 
<code>&lt;ESC&gt;61&lt;ESC&gt;</code> therefore results in an <code>a</code>.

   <p>Be aware that a maxima running on a lisp without unicode support
might not be able to deal with files that contain special unicode
characters.

   <p>Please note that most of these symbols (notable exceptions are the
logic symbols) don't have a special meaning in maxima and therefore
will be interpreted as ordinary characters - or might provoke
unexpected results in case that the maxima is being run
by a lisp that doesn't support dealing with special unicode characters.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.6 Side Panes</h4>

<p>Shortcuts to the most important Maxima commands and a history of the last
issued commands can be accessed using the side panes. They can be enabled
using the "Panes" entry in the "Maxima" menu. The shortcuts can be moved to
where the location is most convenient, inside or outside the wxMaxima window. 
The same commands can be accessed via the menus.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="SidePanes.jpg" alt="SidePanes.jpg"></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.7 MathML output</h4>

<p>It seems that several word processors and similar programs either recognize
MathML input and automatically insert it as an editable 2D equation - or (like
libreOffice 5.1) have an equation editor that offers an &ldquo;import MathML from
clipboard&rdquo; feature. In order to address this wxMaxima offers a &ldquo;copy to word
processor&rdquo; right-click menu entry that outputs the selected part of an
equation in a format the external program (hopefully) understands.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.8 Markdown support</h4>

<p>A wxMaxima workbook can be exported as either an HTML file or a LaTeX file. The
program uses a set of standard markdown conventions. Markdown in many
cases collides with the notations that are frequently used
for mathematics. wxMaxima will recognize bullet lists, though, for the HTML
and TeX export when the items are marked with stars.
<pre class="example">     Ordinary text
      * One item, indentation level 1
      * Another item at indentation level 1
        * An item at a second indentation level
        * A second item at the second indentation level
      * A third item at the first indentation level
     Ordinary text
</pre>
   <p>wxMaxima will also recognize <code>=&gt;</code> and replace it by a
<pre class="example">     cogito =&gt; sum.
</pre>
   <p>Other symbols the markdown parser will recognize are <code>&lt;=</code> and
<code>&gt;=</code> for comparisons, a double-pointed double arrow (<code>&lt;=&gt;</code>),
single- headed arrows (<code>&lt;-&gt;</code>, <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;-</code>) and
<code>+/-</code> as the respective sign. For TeX output also <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and
<code>&gt;&gt;</code> are recognized.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.9 Hotkeys</h4>

<p>Most hotkeys can be found in the text of the respective menus. 
Since they are actually taken from the menu text and thus can be customized
by the translations of wxMaxima to match the needs of users of the local
keyboard, we do not document  them here. 
A few hotkeys or hotkey aliases, though, are not documented in the menus:
     <ul>
<li><code>Ctrl+Shift+Delete</code> deletes a complete cell. 
<li><code>Ctrl+Tab</code> or <code>Ctrl+Shift</code> triggers the auto-completion mechanism. 
<li><code>Ctrl+I</code> or <code>Ctrl+O</code> Zoom in or out. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.10 Raw TeX in the TeX export</h4>

<p>If a text cell begins with <code>TeX:</code> the TeX export contains the literal text
that follows the <code>TeX:</code> marker.

<h3 class="section">1.3 File Formats</h3>

<p>The material that is developed in a wxMaxima session can be stored for
later use in any of three ways:

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 .mac</h4>

<p><samp><span class="file">.mac</span></samp> files are ordinary text files that can be read using
maxima's read command or wxMaxima's File/Batch File menu entry.

   <p>One Example:

   <p>A <samp><span class="file">.mac</span></samp> file named Quadratic.mac was created. It
consists of two commands: <code>f(x) := (x - 5)^2;</code> and
<code>wxdraw2d( explicit(f(x),x,-5,15))</code>. 
The result of entering that batch file appears below. (Some directory
path information is deleted.)

   <div class="block-image"><img src="BatchImage.png" alt="BatchImage.png"></div>

<pre class="example">     %i1 read("test.mac");
</pre>
   <p>You can be use <code>.mac</code> files for writing own library of
macros. But since they don't contain enough structural information
they cannot be read back as a wxMaxima session.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 .wxm</h4>

<p><samp><span class="file">.wxm</span></samp> files contain the input for maxima, as well as any
text cells, title cells and chapter or section cells the user has typed
in. Pictures and Maxima's output are not saved along with the
<samp><span class="file">.wxm</span></samp> file, though.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 .wxmx</h4>

<p>This xml-based file format saves all text and images the work sheet
contains. It is the preferred file format now and comes in two
flavors:
     <ul>
<li>Files saved in the version-control friendly <samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> format
contain all images in a standard compressed format (<samp><span class="file">.png</span></samp>) and
a uncompressed copy of the xml tree that contains the structure of the
document and the text typed in by the user. Since the images are
compressed individually and the text is saved as text a version
control system like bazaar, subversion, git or mercurial will only
have to save the elements of the file that actually have changed since
the last version. 
<li>Files saved in disk space-optimized <samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> format are
compressed as a whole. If no version control system is used this will
save disk space:
          <ul>
<li>The portion of the file that is pure xml data tends to get
fundamentally smaller when being compressed
<li>and after the compression recurring data like image headers
will use up only a fraction of the space they originally did. 
</ul>
     This comes at the cost, though, that the change of even a single line
of text in the uncompressed version tends to completely change the
structure of the compressed version of a file. A version control
system that deals with such a file will - however optimized
it might be on handling differences between binary files -
will therefore have to track (and to store) a much higher number of
differences  between two file versions than necessary;
Since most version control systems compress the data they store on the
server the server space occupied by the initial version of both
<samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> flavors should be nearly identical in size. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">1.4 Configuration options</h3>

<p>For some common configuration variables wxMaxima offers two ways of
configuring:
     <ul>
<li>The configuration dialog box below lets you change their
      default values for the current and subsequent sessions. 
<li>Also, the values for most configuration variables can be changed
      for the current session only by overwiting their values from
      the worksheet, as shown below. 
</ul>

   <div class="block-image"><img src="wxMaxima_configuration_001.png" alt="wxMaxima_configuration_001.png"></div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 Default animation framerate</h4>

<p>The animation framerate that is used for new animations is kept in
the variable <var>wxanimate_framerate</var>. The initial value this
variable will contain in a new worksheet can be changed using the
configuration dialogue.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 Default plot size for new maxima sessions</h4>

<p>After the next start plots embedded into the worksheet will be created
with this size if the value of  <var>wxplot_size</var> isn't changed by
maxima.

   <p>In order to set the plot size of a single graph only use the following
notation can be used that sets a variable's value for one command only:
<pre class="example">     wxdraw2d( explicit(x^2,x,-5,5)), wxplot_size=[480,480]$.
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">1.4.3 Use jsMath fonts</h4>

<p>The style menu allows customization that pertains to the appearance of
your notebook as you work.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="wxMaxima_configuration_002.png" alt="wxMaxima_configuration_002.png"></div>

   <p>It also contains the option to use jsMath fonts. It is a good idea to
install these fonts since they were especially designed for maths and
tend to resolve issues that can be caused by broken fonts. If they are
not installed on your computer, the option to activate them will not
be highlighted. The jsMath fonts can be found on
<a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/258">this site</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.4 Match parenthesis in text controls</h4>

<p>This option enables two things:
     <ul>
<li>If an opening parenthesis, bracket or double quote is entered
wxMaxima will insert a closing one after it. 
<li>If text is selected if any of these keys is pressed the selected
text will be put between the matched signs. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.5 Autosave interval</h4>

<p>If this value is set to a value bigger than zero maxima will work in a
more mobile-device-like fashion:
     <ul>
<li>Files are saved automatically on exit
<li>And the file will automatically be saved every n minutes. 
</ul>
   For the automatic saving functionality to work wxMaxima needs to know
a name to save the file with, though. This means this feature will
only work if the file has already been saved to or opened from the
disk.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Extensions to maxima</h2>

<p>wxMaxima is predominantly a graphical user interface for Maxima. That is, it primarily
passes along commands to Maxima and reports the results of executing those commands. In some
cases, however, it adds functionality to Maxima. wxMaxima's ability to generate reports by
exporting a workbook's contents to HTML and LaTeX files has been mentioned. This section
considers some ways that wxMaxima enhances the inclusion of graphics into a session. 
described here.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Subscripted variables</h3>

<p>if <var>wxsubscripts</var> is set to true variable names of the format <code>x_y</code> are
displayed using a subscript if
     <ul>
<li><code>y</code> is a single letter
<li><code>y</code> is an integer
</ul>

   <p>If the variable name doesn't match these requirements it can still be declared as
"to be subscripted" using the command
<code>wxdeclare_subscript(variable_name);</code> or <code>wxdeclare_subscript([variable_name1,variable_name2,...]);</code>
Declaring a variable as subscripted can be reverted using the following command:
<code>wxdeclare_subscript(variable_name,false);</code>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Plotting</h3>

<p>Plotting (having fundamentally to do with graphics) is a place where a
graphical user interface will have to provide some extensions to the
original program.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Embedding a plot into the work sheet</h4>

<p>Maxima normally instructs the external program gnuplot to open a
separate window for every diagram it creates. Since many times it is
convenient to embed graphs into the work sheet instead wxMaxima
provides its own set of plot functions that don't differ from the
corresponding maxima functions save in their name: They are all
prefixed by a &ldquo;wx&rdquo;. For example  <samp><span class="command">wxplot</span></samp> corresponds to
<samp><span class="command">plot</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">wxdraw</span></samp> corresponds to <samp><span class="command">draw</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">wxhistogram</span></samp> corresponds to <samp><span class="command">histogram</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 Making embedded plots bigger or smaller</h4>

<p>As noted above, the configure dialog provides a way to change the default size plots
are created with which sets the starting value of <var>wxplot_size</var>. 
The plotting routines of wxMaxima respect this variable that specifies
the size of a plot in pixels. It can always be queried or used to set
the size of the following plots:
<pre class="example">     %i1 wxplot_size:[1200,800];
     %o1 [1200,800];
     
     %i2 wxdraw2d(
             explicit(
                 sin(x),
                 x,1,10
             )
         )$
</pre>
   <p>If the size of only one plot is to be changed maxima provides a
canonical way to change an attribute only for the current cell.
<pre class="example">          %i1 wxplot_size:[1200,800];
          %o1 [1200,800];
     
          %i1 wxdraw2d(
                  explicit(
                      sin(x),
                      x,1,10
                  )
              ),wxplot_size=[1600,800]$
     
     %i1 wxdraw2d(
             explicit(
                 sin(x),
                 x,1,10
             )
         ),wxplot_size=[1600,800]$
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Better quality plots</h4>

<p>Gnuplot doesn't seem to provide a portable way of determining whether it
supports the high-quality bitmap output the <code>cairo</code> library provides. 
On systems where gnuplot is compiled to use this library the
pngcairo option from the configuration menu (that can be overridden
by the variable <var>wxplot_pngcairo</var>) enables support for
antialiasing and additional line styles.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.4 Embedding animations into the spreadsheet</h4>

<p>The <code>with_slider_draw</code> command is a version of <code>wxdraw2d</code>
that does prepare multiple plots and allows to switch between them
by moving the slider on top of the screen. If ImageMagick is installed
wxMaxima even allows to export this animation as an animated gif.

   <p>The first two arguments for <code>with_slider_draw</code> are the name of
the variable that is stepped between the plots and a list of the
values of these variable. The arguments that follow are the ordinary
arguments for <code>wxdraw2d</code>:
<pre class="example">     with_slider_draw(
         f,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10],
         title=concat("f=",f,"Hz"),
         explicit(
             sin(2*%pi*f*x),
             x,0,1
         ),grid=true
     );
</pre>
   <p>The same functionality for 3d plots is accessible as <code>with_slider_draw3d</code>.

   <p>There is a second set of functions making use of the slider
     <ul>
<li><code>wxanimate_draw</code> and
<li><code>wxanimate_draw3d</code>:
</ul>

<pre class="example">     wxanimate_draw(
         a, 3,
         explicit(sin(a*x), x, -4, 4),
         title=printf(false, "a=~a", a));
</pre>
   <p>Normally the animations are played back or exported with the frame
rate chosen in the configuration of wxMaxima. To set the speed an
individual animation is played back the variable <var>wxanimate_framerate</var>
can be used:
<pre class="example">     wxanimate(a, 10,
         sin(a*x), [x,-5,5]), wxanimate_framerate=6$
</pre>
   <p>The animation functions have a pitfall that one has to be aware of when
using them: The slider variable's value are substituted into the
expression that is to be plotted - which will fail, if the variable
isn't directly visible in the expression. Therefore the following
example will fail:
<pre class="example">     f:sin(a*x);
     with_slider_draw(
         a,makelist(i/2,i,1,10),
         title=concat("a=",float(a)),
         grid=true,
         explicit(f,x,0,10)
     )$
</pre>
   <p>If Maxima is forced to first evaluate the expression and then asked
to substitute the slider's value plotting works fine instead:
<pre class="example">     f:sin(a*x);
     with_slider_draw(
         a,makelist(i/2,i,1,10),
         title=concat("a=",float(a)),
         grid=true,
         explicit(''f,x,0,10)
     )$
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">2.2.5 Opening multiple plots in contemporaneous windows</h4>

<p>While not being a provided by wxMaxima this feature of Maxima (on
setups that support it) sometimes comes in handily. The following
example comes from a post from Mario Rodriguez to the Maxima mailing
list:
<pre class="example">     load(draw);
     
     /* Parabola in window #1 */
     draw2d(terminal=[wxt,1],explicit(x^2,x,-1,1));
     
     /* Parabola in window #2 */
     draw2d(terminal=[wxt,2],explicit(x^2,x,-1,1));
     
     /* Paraboloid in window #3 */
     draw3d(terminal=[wxt,3],explicit(x^2+y^2,x,-1,1,y,-1,1));
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">2.3 Embedding graphics</h3>

<p>if the <samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> file format is being used embedding files in a
wxMaxima project can be done as easily as per drag-and-drop. But
sometimes (for example if an image's contents might change later on in
a session)
it is better to tell the file to load the image on evaluation:
<pre class="example">     show_image("Mann.png");
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">2.4 wxmaximarc</h3>

<p><a name="index-Startup-File-3"></a>If the Maxima user directory there is a text file named <samp><span class="file">wxmaxima-init.mac</span></samp>
the contents of the file is passed to Maxima automatically every time
a new worksheet has been started.

   <p>To find out which directory Maxima uses as the user directory just
type in the following line:
<pre class="example">     maxima_userdir;
</pre>
   <p>The answer from Maxima will specify the name of the directory that the
startup file can be placed in.
<pre class="example">     %o1 /home/username/.maxima
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">2.5 Special variables</h3>

     <ul>
<li><var>wxsubscripts</var> tells maxima if it should convert variable
      names that contain an underscore (<code>R_150</code>) or the like into
      subscripted variables. See <code>wxdeclare_subscript</code> for details
      which variable names are automatically converted. 
<li><var>wxfilename</var> This variable contains the name of the file
currently opened in wxMaxima. On windows this piece of information
is only available if in the configuration dialogue the checkbox <code>Maxima/maxima's pwd is path to document</code> is checked. 
<li><var>wxplot_pngcairo</var> tells if wxMaxima tries to use gnuplot's
pngcairo terminal that provides more line styles and a better overall
graphics quality. This variable can be used for reading or overriding
the respective setting in the configuration dialog. 
<li><var>wxplot_size</var> defines the size of embedded plots. 
<li><var>wxchangedir</var> On most operating systems wxMaxima
      automatically sets Maxima's working directory to the directory
      of the current file. This will allow file I/O (e.g. by
      <code>read_matrix</code>) to work without specifying the whole path to the
      file that has to be read or written. On Windows this is
      deactivated, though: The Lisp Standard doesn't contain a concept of
      the current working directory. Therefore there is no standard
      way of setting it and changing to a directory that isn't on
      the drive Maxima has been installed to might cause Maxima to
      try to read is own package files from this drive, too, instead
      of from the drive Maxima has been installed to. Setting
      <var>wxchangedir</var> to <code>true</code> tells wxMmaxima that it has to
      risk that and to set Maxima's working directory. 
<li><var>wxanimate_framerate</var> The number of frames per second the
      following animations have to be played back with. -1 tells
      wxMaxima to use the default frame rate from the config dialog. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">2.6 Pretty-printing 2D output</h3>

<p>The function <code>(table_form)</code> displays a 2D list in a form that is
more readable than the output Maxima's default output routine.
<pre class="example">     table_form(
         [
             [1,2],
             [3,4]
         ]
     )$
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">2.7 Bug reporting</h3>

<p>wxMaxima provides a few functions that gather bug reporting
information about the current system:
     <ul>
<li><code>wxbuild_info()</code> gathers information about the currently
running version of wxMaxima
<li><code>wxbug_report()</code> tells how and where to file bugs

<h2 class="chapter">3 Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Cannot connect to Maxima</h3>

<p>Since Maxima (the program that does the actual mathematics) and
wxMaxima (providing the easy-to-use user interface) are separate
programs that communicate by the means of a local network connection. 
Therefore the most probable cause is that this connection is somehow not
working. For example a firewall could be set up in a way that it
doesn't just prevent against unauthorized connections from the
internet (and perhaps to intercept some connections to the internet,
too), but it also to blocks inter-process-communication inside the same
computer. Note that since Maxima is being run by a lisp processor
the process communication that is blocked from does not necessarily
have to be named "maxima". Common names of the program that opens
the network connection would be <samp><span class="file">sbcl</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">gcl</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">ccl</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">lisp.exe</span></samp> or similar names.

   <p>On Un*x computers another possible reason
would be that the loopback network that provides network connections
between two programs in the same computer isn't properly configured.

<h3 class="section">3.2 How to save data from a broken .wxmx file</h3>

<p>Internally most modern xml-based formats are ordinary zip-files with
one special characteristic: the first file in the archive is stored uncompressed
and provides information about what type of program can open this
file.

   <p>If the zip signature at the end of the file is still intact
after renaming a broken <samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> file to <samp><span class="file">.zip</span></samp> most operating
systems will provide a way to extract any portion of information that
is stored inside it. The can be done when there is the need of
recovering the original image files from a text processor document. 
If the zip signature isn't intact that does not need to be the end
of the world: If wxMaxima during saving detected that something went
wrong there will be a <samp><span class="file">wxmx~</span></samp> file whose contents might help and
even if there isn't such a file: If the configuration option is set
that <samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> files have to be optimized for version control
it is possible to rename the <samp><span class="file">.wxmx</span></samp> file to a <samp><span class="file">.txt</span></samp> file
and to use a text editor to recover the file's contents.

<h3 class="section">3.3 wxMaxima waits forever for data from Maxima</h3>

<p>In old versions of Maxima this might be caused by the fact that a closing
brace, bracket, parenthesis or hyphenation mark is missing: In this case
Maxima waits until it gets the rest of its input (which it never
does).

   <p>In order to find out if this is the issue the operating system
normally provides a way to determine if Maxima is actually
really working forever trying to solve the current problem.

<h3 class="section">3.4 I want some debug info to be displayed on the screen before my command has finished</h3>

<p>Normally wxMaxima waits for the whole 2D formula to be transferred before
it begins to typeset. This saves time for making many attempts to typeset a
only partially completed equation. There is a <code>disp</code> command, though, that
will provide debug output immediately and without waiting for the current
Maxima command to finish, though:
<pre class="example">     for i:1 thru 10 do (
        disp(i),
        t:makelist(i,i,1000000),
        length(t)
     )$
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">3.5 wxMaxima on Windows crashes on displaying seemingly simple equations</h3>

<p>The jsMath fonts allow for excellent 2D-display of equations. But there
are of broken versions of this package that crash wxMaxima. 
A working version can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsmath/download/jsMath-fonts.html math.union.edu">http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsmath/download/jsMath-fonts.html math.union.edu</a>. To make wxMaxima actually use these fonts
the according checkbox has to be enabled in the Styles tab of wxMaxima's
configuration dialogue.

<h3 class="section">3.6 Outputting animations doesn't work</h3>

<p>wxMaxima relies on a third-party tool
(<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>) to convert
animations to the animated gif format. This will obviously only work
if this package is installed and known to the system (on windows the path
to ImageMagick's <samp><span class="file">convert.exe</span></samp> has to be part of the <var>PATH</var> system
variable to make the system find it).

   <p>Another possible reason of not getting an animated gif is that this
image would exceed the format's (or ImageMagick's) capabilities:
     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="file">.gif</span></samp> files only allow for a maximum of 256 frames
<li><samp><span class="file">.gif</span></samp> files can not exceed 65535x65535 pixels
<li>ImageMagick has to have access to enough memory to hold all frames in
      their uncompressed form. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">3.7 Plotting only shows an closed empty envelope with an error message</h3>

<p>This means that wxMaxima was unable to read the file Maxima was supposed
to instruct gnuplot to create.

   <p>Possible reasons that might cause this are:
     <ul>
<li>The plotting command is part of a third-party package like
      <code>implicit_plot</code> but this package wasn't loaded by Maxima's
      <code>load()</code> command before trying to plot. 
<li>Maxima tried to do something the currently installed version of
      gnuplot isn't able to understand. In this case the file
      <samp><span class="file">maxout.gnuplot</span></samp> in the directory Maxima's variable
      <var>maxima_userdir</var> points to contains the instructions from
      Maxima to gnuplot. Most of the time this file's contents therefore is
      helpful when debugging the problem. 
<li>Gnuplot was instructed to use the pngcairo library that provides
      antialiassing and additional line styles, but it wasn't compiled to
      support this possibility. Solution: Uncheck the "Use the cairo
      terminal for plot" checkbox in the configuration dialog and
      don't set <var>wxplot_pngcairo</var> to true from Maxima. 
<li>Gnuplot didn't output a valid <samp><span class="file">.png</span></samp> file. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">3.8 Plotting an animation results in &ldquo;error: undefined variable&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The value of the slider variable by default is only substituted into the
expression that is to be plotted if it is visible there. Putting an
<code>ev()</code> around this expression should resolve this problem.

<h3 class="section">3.9 I lost a cell contents and undo doesn't remember</h3>

<p>There are separate undo functions for cell operations and for changes
inside of cells so chances are low that this ever happens. If it does
there are several methods to recover data:
     <ul>
<li>wxMaxima actually has two undo features: The global undo buffer
that is active if no cell is selected and a per-cell undo buffer that is
active if the cursor is inside a cell. It is worth trying to use both undo
options in order to see if an old value can still be accessed. 
<li>If you still have a way to find out what label Maxima has assigned
to the cell just type in the cell's label and it's contents will
reappear. 
<li>If you don't: Don't panic. In the &ldquo;Maxima&rdquo; menu there
is a way to show a history pane that shows all Maxima commands that
have been issued recently. 
<li>If nothing else helps Maxima contains a replay feature:
     <pre class="example">          %i1 playback();
     </pre>
     </ul>

<h3 class="section">3.10 wxMaxima starts up with the message &ldquo;Maxima process Terminated.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>One possible reason is that Maxima cannot be found in the location that is
set in the &ldquo;Maxima&rdquo; tab of wxMaxima's configuration dialog and therefore
won't run at all. Setting the path to a working Maxima binary should
fix this problem.

<h3 class="section">3.11 Maxima is forever calculating and not responding to input</h3>

<p>It is theoretically possible that wxMaxima doesn't realize that Maxima has
finished calculating and therefore never gets informed it can send new data
to Maxima. If this is the case &ldquo;Trigger evaluation&rdquo; might resynchronize
the two programs.

<h3 class="section">3.12 File I/O from Maxima doesn't work on Windows</h3>

<p>On windows File I/O isn't relative to the directory of the current
file by default. If you store the Maxima file on the drive wxMaxima is
installed to setting <var>wxchangedir</var> to <code>true</code> will fix
that for <code>load</code>, <code>read_list</code>, <code>batch</code>,
<code>read_matrix</code>, <code>save</code> and all similar commands.

   <p>Setting this variable to <code>true</code> might have a drawback, though:
Maxima knows which directory it is installed in and will search for
any additional package that is requested by a <code>load</code> command in
this directory, too. But it might not know which drive it is installed
on. If <var>wxchangedir</var> is <code>true</code> and the current file is saved
on a different drive than the one Maxima is installed on Maxima
therefore might fail to load the additional packages it was bundled
with.

<h3 class="section">3.13 My sbcl-based maxima runs out of memory</h3>

<p>SBCL by default comes with a memory limit that allows it to run even on
low-end computers. When compiling a big software package like lapack
or dealing with extremely big lists or equations this limit might be
too low. In order to extend the limits sbcl can be provided with the
command line parameter
<code>--dynamic-space-size</code> that tells sbcl how many megabytes it
should reserve. A 32bit-windows-sbcl can reserve up to 999 Megabytes,
1800. A 64-bit sbcl version running on windows can be instructed to use
more than the about 1280 Megabytes compiling lapack needs.

   <p>One way to provide maxima (and thus sbcl) with command line parameters is
the <code>additional parameters</code> field of wxMaxima's configuration
dialogue.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="sbclMemory.png" alt="sbclMemory.png"></div>

<h3 class="section">3.14 Input sometimes is sluggish/ignoring keys on Ubuntu</h3>

<p>Installing the package <code>ibus-gtk</code> should resolve this issue. See
(<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wxwidgets3.0/+bug/1421558">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wxwidgets3.0/+bug/1421558</a>) for details.

<h3 class="section">3.15 wxMaxima halts when Maxima processes Greek characters or Umlauts</h3>

<p>If your Maxima is based on sbcl the following lines have to be added to your
<samp><span class="file">.sblrc</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     (setf sb-impl::*default-external-format* :utf-8)
</pre>
   <p>The folder this file has to be placed in is system- and installation-specific. 
But any sbcl-based Maxima that already has evaluated
a cell in the current session will happily tell where it can be found after
getting the following command:
<pre class="example">     :lisp (sb-impl::userinit-pathname)
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">3.16 Plotting</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">3.16.1 Can I make wxMaxima output both image files and embedded plots at once?</h4>

<p>It is easier to make it first generate the images and then import them again
as the following two functions will do:
<pre class="example">     load("draw");
     pngdraw(name,[contents]):=
     (
         draw(
             append(
                 [
                     terminal=pngcairo,
                     dimensions=wxplot_size,
                     file_name=name
                 ],
                 contents
             )
         ),
         show_image(printf(false,"~a.png",name))
     );
     pngdraw2d(name,[contents]):=
         pngdraw(name,gr2d(contents));
     
     pngdraw2d("Test",

     );

   <h4 class="subsection">3.16.2 Can I set the aspect ratio of a plot?</h4>

<p>Not directly using Maxima. But there are gnuplot commands for it:
<pre class="example">          wxdraw2d(
              user_preamble="set size ratio 1;set tmargin 3;set bmargin 3;set lmargin 3;set rmargin 3",
              explicit(sin(x),x,1,10)
          ),wxplot_size=[1000,1000];
</pre>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Is there a way to make more text fit on a pdfLaTeX page?</h3>

<p>There is: Just add the following lines to the LaTeX preamble (for
example by using the respective field in the config dialog):
<pre class="example">     \usepackage[a4paper,landscape,left=1cm,right=1cm,top=1cm,bottom=1cm]{geometry}
</pre>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Command-line arguments</h2>

<p>Most operating systems provide less complicated ways of
starting programs than the command line so this possibility
is only rarely used. wxMaxima still provides some
command line switches, though.
     <ul>
<li><code>-v</code> or <code>--version</code>: Output the version information
<li><code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code>: Output a short help text
<li><code>-o</code> or <code>--open</code>: Open the filename given as argument to this
      command-line switch
<li><code>-b</code> or <code>--batch</code>: If the command-line opens a file all cells in this file are
      evaluated and the file is saved afterwards. This is for example useful if
      the sesson described in the file makes Maxima generate output files. 
      Batch-processing will be stopped if wxMaxima detects that Maxima has output
      an error and will pause if Maxima has a question: Mathematics is somewhat
      interactive by nature so a completely interaction-free batch processing
      cannot always be guaranteed. 
<li>(Only on windows): <code>-f</code> or <code>--ini</code>: Use the init file that was
      given as argument to this command-line switch
</ul>
   Instead of a minus some operating systems might use a dash in
front of the command-line switches.
