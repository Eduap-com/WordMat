This is a partial implmentation of a maple to macsyma translator.
It is implemented using the antlr parser generator and stringtemplate.
It does a mostly syntactic translation of maple. The grammar is
based on François Thomasset's maple grammar which was written for
ocaml.
The tracing and intermediate print statements can be ignored.
Comments need to be transmitted to the output as well.
