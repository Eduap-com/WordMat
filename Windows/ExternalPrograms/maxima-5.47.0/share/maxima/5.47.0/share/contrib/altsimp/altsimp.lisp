To simplify a sum with n terms, the standard simplus function calls
great O(n^2) times. By using sorting more effectively, this code
reduces theÂ calls to O(n log_2(n)).

Also, this code tries to be "infinity correct" for addition. By this I
mean inf + inf --> inf, inf + number --> inf, and inf + minf --> und.
Since -1 * inf does not simplify to minf, this code doesn't simplify
inf - inf to und; consequently, this portion of the code is largely
untested. There are other problems too.  For one, this code does
f(inf) - f(inf) --> 0 (comment from Stavros Macrakis). I don't know
how far we can go with such things without making a mess. You could
argue that Maxima should do

   f(x) - f(x) --> if finitep(f(x)) then 0 else und 

instead of f(x) - f(x) --> 0.

There is a great deal more that could be done. We could tag each
infinity with a unique identifier (idea from RJF). That way we could
have x : inf, x - x --> 0 and x : inf, y : inf, x - y --> und, for
example.

In short, this code is highly experimental; you should not use it for
anything that is important. I place it in /share/contrib because
others encouraged me too; also I thought it might be useful to others
who would like to experiment with similar code. Since a great deal of
work has gone into the current simplus code, I'm not sure that a total
rewrite is the best route.

Maybe the special case dispatch part of this code makes the task of
extending simplus (to intervals, for example) easier. The basic design
of this code is due to Barton Willis.

As of late May 2021, altsimp (with use_extended_real_arithmetic set to false), runs 
the testsuite + the share testsuite with nine failures; the failures are

 rtest11.mac problems (4 8)
 rtest14.mac problem: (62)
 rtest_expintegral.mac problems: (173 174)
 rtest_dgesv.mac problem: (5)
 rtest_to_poly_solve.mac problem: (241)

Additionally, rtest3 #146 fails (errcatch(integrate(exp(2^(3/2)*x^2-sqrt(2)*x^2),x))), but 
actually, altsimp fixes this bug. This is due to the fact that with altsimp, exp(2^(3/2)*x^2-sqrt(2)*x^2) 
simplifies to %e^(sqrt(2)*x^2).

Reasons for these failures include:

* Possible differences in ordering of addition of floating point numbers.

Using CCL 1.12.1 (64 bit) and altsimp, timings are:

took 752,166,000 microseconds (752.166000 seconds) to run.
      12,556,790 microseconds ( 12.556790 seconds, 1.67%) of which was spent in GC.
During that period, and with 4 available CPU cores,
     687,062,500 microseconds (687.062500 seconds) were spent in user mode
      38,109,375 microseconds ( 38.109375 seconds) were spent in system mode
87,194,237,408 bytes of memory allocated.

And timings for standard Maxima are:

took 689,231,000 microseconds (689.231000 seconds) to run.
      11,857,789 microseconds ( 11.857789 seconds, 1.72%) of which was spent in GC.
During that period, and with 4 available CPU cores,
     644,234,375 microseconds (644.234400 seconds) were spent in user mode
      23,062,500 microseconds ( 23.062500 seconds) were spent in system mode
 77,100,115,920 bytes of memory allocated.

 Compared to standard Maxima, altsimp runs the testsuites more slowly and uses more
 memory. Using sbcl 2.0, the results are similar, but faster and more memory.

Using CCL 1.12.1 (64 bit) and use_extended_real_arithmetic set to true, the
testsuites give 45 failures:

Error(s) found:
  rtest11.mac problems:  (4 8)
  rtest14.mac problem: (62)
  rtest16.mac problems:  (457 459)
  rtest3.mac problem: (146)
  rtest_expintegral.mac problems: (173 174)
  rtest_powerseries.mac problems: (53 63)
  solve_rec/rtest_simplify_sum.mac problems: (3 4 5 6 7 10 11 12 13 14 16 17 19 
  20 21 22 23 28 29 53 67 68 69 70 71 72)
  rtest_dgesv.mac problem: (5)
  rtest_linalg.mac problems: (92 94)
  rtest_abs_integrate.mac problems: (75 76 77 132 140)
  rtest_to_poly_solve.mac problem: (241)

Most of these additional failures are due to dispatching sign on und.



Speculation on how to speed up simplification of sums:

The altsimp algorithm uses sorting to speed up simplification of expressions with a 
large number of summands, but at least for running the testsuites, simplus is mostly 
called with just two summands. If one of the two summands is a sum, say XXX, altsimp 
re-examines the terms of XXX for common terms. That is, of course, wasteful. If the 
summands were marked in a way that indicated that pairs of terms were not common, that 
would possibly speed the code.
