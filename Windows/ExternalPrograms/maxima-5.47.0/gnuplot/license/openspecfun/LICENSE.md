## AMOS license

Based on the discussion at http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Can-we-freely-use-AMOS-in-Octave-td4642557.html, AMOS is included in openspecfun as public domain software

> The AMOS functions are included in SLATEC, and the SLATEC guide 
> (http://www.netlib.org/slatec/guide) explicitly states: 
>
>     "The Library is in the public domain and distributed by the Energy 
>     Science and Technology Software Center." 
>
> Mention of AMOS's inclusion in SLATEC goes back at least to this 1985 
> technical report from Sandia National Labs:
