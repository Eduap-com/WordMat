#Windows-folder
This folder contains all the files required to build WordMat for Windows.
Run the inno setup script: ‘WordMat-InnoScript’ to create the WordMat.exe file

You must install Inno Setup to build and edit the script-file: [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) or [Inno script studio](https://www.kymoto.org/products/inno-script-studio/)

In the root folder:
WordMat.dotm   - Contains the main code in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
Right click the file and choose open. Then press alt+F11 to open the VBE and see the code.

Normally the exe-file is codesigned before release
