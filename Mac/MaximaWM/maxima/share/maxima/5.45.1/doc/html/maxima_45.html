<span id="Introduction-to-Simplification-1"></span><h3 class="section">9.1 Introduction to Simplification</h3>

<p>Maxima performs a cycle of actions in response to each new user-typed command. This 
consists of four steps: reading or &quot;parsing&quot; the input, evaluation, simplification 
and output. Parsing converts a syntactically valid sequence of typed characters into 
a data structure to be used for the rest of the operations. Evaluation includes 
replacing names with their assigned values. Simplification means rewriting an 
expression to be easier for the user or other programs to understand. Output includes 
displaying computational results in a variety of different formats and notations.
</p>
<p>Evaluation and simplification sometimes appear to have similar functionality as they 
both have the goal of removing &quot;complexity&quot; and system designers have sometimes divided a 
task so that it is performed partly in each. For example, <code>integrate(x,x)</code> evaluates 
the answer as <code>x*x/2</code>, which is then simplified to <code>x^2/2</code>.
</p>
<p>Evaluation is always present: it is the consequence of having a programming system with 
functions, subroutines, variables, values, loops, assignments and so on. In the 
evaluation step, built-in or user-defined function names are replaced by their definitions, 
variables are replaced by their values. This is largely the same as activities of a 
conventional programming language, but extended to work with symbolic mathematical data. 
Because of the generality of the mathematics at hand, there are different possible models 
of evaluation and so the systems has optional &quot;flags&quot; that can steer the process of 
evaluation. See <a href="maxima_43.html">Functions and Variables for Evaluation</a>.
</p>
<p>By contrast, the intent of simplification is to maintain the value of an expression 
while re-formulating its representation to be smaller, simpler to understand, or to 
conform to particular specifications (like factored, expanded). For
example, <code>sin(0)</code> to <code>0</code> or <code>x+x to 2*x</code>.
There are several powerful tools to alter the results 
of simplification, since it is largely in this part of the system that an user can 
incorporate knowledge of newly introduced functions or symbolic notation into Maxima.
</p>
<p>Simplification is generally done at four different levels:
</p><ul>
<li> The internal, built-in automated simplifier,
</li><li> Built-in simplification routines that can be explicitly called by the user
      at selected places in a program or command sequence,
</li><li> User-written simplification routines, linked to the simplifier by using
      &quot;tellsimp&quot; or &quot;tellsimpafter&quot; and called automatically,
</li><li> User-written routines that can be explicitly called by the user at selected 
      places in a program or command sequence.
</li></ul>
<p>The internal simplifier belongs to the heart of Maxima. It is a large and 
complicated collection of programs, and it has been refined over many years and by 
thousands of users. Nevertheless, especially if you are trying out novel ideas or 
unconventional notation, you may find it helpful to make small (or large) changes 
to the program yourself. For details see for example the paper at the end of
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/intro5.txt">https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/intro5.txt</a>.
</p>
<p>Maxima internally represents expressions as &quot;trees&quot; with operators or &quot;roots&quot;
like <code>+</code>, <code>*</code> , <code>=</code> and operands (&quot;leaves&quot;) which are variables like
<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>z</var>, functions
or sub-trees, like <code>x*y</code>. Each operator has a simplification program
associated with it.  <code>+</code> (which also covers binary <code>-</code> since
<code>a-b = a+(-1)*b)</code> and <code>*</code> (which also covers <code>/</code> 
since <code>a/b = a*b^(-1)</code>) have rather elaborate simplification programs. These 
simplification programs (simplus, simptimes, simpexpt, etc.) are called whenever 
the simplifier encounters the respective arithmetic operators in an expression 
tree to be analyzed. 
</p>
<p>The structure of the simplifier dates back to 1965, and many hands have worked 
on it through the years. The structure turns out to be, in modern jargon, data-
directed, or object-oriented. The program dispatches to the appropriate routine 
depending on the root of some sub-tree of the expression, recursively. This general
notion means you can make modifications to the simplification process by very local 
changes to the program. In many cases it is conceptually straightforward to add an 
operator and add its simplification routine without disturbing existing code.
</p>
<p>We note that in addition to this general simplifier operating on algebraic 
expression trees, there are several other representations of expressions in 
Maxima which have separate methods and simplifiers. For example, the
<code><a href="maxima_76.html#rat">rat</a></code> function converts polynomials to vectors of coefficients to
assist in rapid manipulation of such forms. Other representations include
Taylor series and the (rarely used) Poisson series.
</p>
<p>All operators introduced by the user initially have no simplification
programs associated with them.  Maxima does not know anything about
function &quot;f&quot;  and so typing <code>f(a,b)</code> will result in simplifying
<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>, but not <code>f</code>. 
Even some built-in operators have no simplifications. For example,
<code>=</code> does not &quot;simplify&quot; &ndash; it is a place-holder with no
simplification semantics other 
than to simplify its two arguments, in this case referred to as the left and 
right sides. Other parts of Maxima such as the solve program take special 
note of equations, that is, trees with <code>=</code> as the root. 
(Note &ndash; in Maxima, the assignment operation is <code>:</code> . That is, <code>q: 4</code>
sets the value of the symbol <var>q</var> to <code>4</code>.
Function definition is done with <code>:=</code>. )
</p>
<p>The general simplifier returns results with an internal flag indicating the 
expression and each sub-expression has been simplified. This does not 
guarantee that it is unique over all possible equivalent expressions. That&rsquo;s 
too hard (theoretically, not possible given the generality of what can be 
expressed in Maxima). However, some aspects of the expression, such as the 
ordering of terms in a sum or product, are made uniform. This is important 
for the other programs to work properly.
</p>
<p>You can set a number of option variables which direct Maxima&rsquo;s processing to 
favor particular kinds of patterns as being goals. You can even use the most 
extreme option which is to turn the simplifier off by simp:false. We do not 
recommend this since many internal routines expect their arguments to be 
simplified. (About the only time it seems plausible to turn off the simplifier 
is in the rare case that you want to over-ride a built-in simplification. 
In that case  you might temporarily disable the simplifier, put in the new 
transformation via <code><a href="maxima_156.html#tellsimp">tellsimp</a></code>, and then re-enable the simplifier
by <code>simp:true</code>.)
</p>
<p>It is more plausible for you to associate user-defined symbolic function names 
or operators with properties (<code><a href="maxima_46.html#additive">additive</a></code>,
<code><a href="maxima_46.html#lassociative">lassociative</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#oddfun">oddfun</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#antisymmetric">antisymmetric</a></code>,
<code><a href="maxima_46.html#linear">linear</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#outative">outative</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#commutative">commutative</a></code>, 
<code><a href="maxima_46.html#multiplicative">multiplicative</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#rassociative">rassociative</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#evenfun">evenfun</a></code>,
<code><a href="maxima_58.html#nary">nary</a></code> and <code><a href="maxima_46.html#symmetric">symmetric</a></code>). These options steer 
the simplifier processing in systematic directions.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>declare(f,oddfun)</code> specifies that <code>f</code> is an odd function.
Maxima will simplify <code>f(-x)</code> to <code>-f(x)</code>. In the case of an even
function, that is <code>declare(g,evenfun)</code>, 
Maxima will simplify <code>g(-x)</code> to <code>g(x)</code>. You can also associate a
programming function with a name such as <code>h(x):=x^2+1</code>. In that case the
evaluator will immediately replace 
<code>h(3)</code> by <code>10</code>, and <code>h(a+1)</code> by <code>(a+1)^2+1</code>, so any properties
of <code>h</code> will be ignored.
</p>
<p>In addition to these directly related properties set up by the user, facts and 
properties from the actual context may have an impact on the simplifier&rsquo;s behavior, 
too. See <a href="maxima_57.html">Introduction to Maxima&rsquo;s Database</a>.
</p>
<p>Example: <code>sin(n*%pi)</code> is simplified to zero, if <var>n</var> is an integer.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(%i1) sin(n*%pi);
(%o1)                      sin(%pi n)
</pre><pre class="example">(%i2) declare(n, integer);
(%o2)                         done
</pre><pre class="example">(%i3) sin(n*%pi);
(%o3)                           0
</pre></div>

<p>If automated simplification is not sufficient, you can consider a variety of 
built-in, but explicitly called simplfication functions (<code><a href="maxima_76.html#ratsimp">ratsimp</a></code>,
<code><a href="maxima_46.html#expand">expand</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_76.html#factor">factor</a></code>, <code><a href="maxima_46.html#radcan">radcan</a></code> and others). There are
also flags that will push simplification into one or another direction.
Given <code>demoivre:true</code> the simplifier rewrites 
complex exponentials as trigonometric forms. Given <code>exponentialize:true</code>
the  simplifier tries to do the reverse: rewrite trigonometric forms as complex 
exponentials.
</p>
<p>As everywhere in Maxima, by writing your own functions (be it in the Maxima 
user language or in the implementation language Lisp) and explicitly calling them 
at selected places in the program, you can respond to your individual 
simplification needs. Lisp gives you a handle on all the internal mechanisms, but 
you rarely need this full generality. &quot;Tellsimp&quot; is designed to generate much 
of the Lisp internal interface into the simplifier automatically.
See See <a href="maxima_154.html">Rules and Patterns</a>.
</p>
<p>Over the years (Maxima/Macsyma&rsquo;s origins date back to about 1966!) users have 
contributed numerous application packages and tools to extend or alter its 
functional behavior. Various non-standard and &quot;share&quot; packages exist to modify 
or extend simplification as well. You are invited to look into this more 
experimental material where work is still in progress See <a href="maxima_312.html">simplification</a>.
</p>
<p>The following appended material is optional on a first reading, and reading it 
is not necessary for productive use of Maxima. It is for the curious user who 
wants to understand what is going on, or the ambitious programmer who might 
wish to change the (open-source) code. Experimentation with redefining Maxima 
Lisp code is easily possible: to change the definition of a Lisp program (say 
the one that simplifies <code>cos()</code>, named <code>simp%cos</code>), you simply
load into Maxima a text file that will overwrite the <code>simp%cos</code> function
from the maxima package.
