Dear User:

This archive contains 2 files which provide Grobner basis support for the
free computer algebra system Maxima. In order to use the package, start your
Maxima and put it in the lisp mode (on most systems, CTRL-C will do this),
and execute the following commands:

(load "grobner.lisp")
(compile-file "grobner.lisp" :load t)


The file grobner.demo is a Macsyma-style demo file for most of the operations
provided by the package. In order to run it, go to the Maxima level and
type:

demo("grobner.demo");

or

batch("grobner.demo");

and watch the demonstration.

Maxima documentation for this package has not been written yet, but
there is a sizable amount of documentation in the LISP source.


The file grobner.lisp was constructed by a semi-automatic
process from the sources of a package CGBlisp, version 2 also authored by 
me, which will eventually be released at my Web site (see below).
An older version of CGBlisp is available at the Web site.

Enjoy.
