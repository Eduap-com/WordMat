This is fine.  You should reference the article:

Michael Wester, ``A Critique of the Mathematical Abilities of CA Systems'',
{\sl Computer Algebra Systems: A Practical Guide}, edited by Michael~J. Wester,
John Wiley \& Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom, 1999, 25--60.

that is associated with them (as well as the original source, of course).

Adding correct/expected results seems like a good idea for an automated test
suite.  What other testing material are you including?

I'll be interested to hear how well the current version of Maxima does on these
tests!
