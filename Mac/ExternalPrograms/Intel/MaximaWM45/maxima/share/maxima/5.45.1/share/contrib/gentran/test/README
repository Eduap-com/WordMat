Files here can be used to test the gentran package.  It include some
example programs described in section 6 of the the gentran manual.

The name.v file can be batched into vaxima and a name.f file will be produced.
This should match exactly the corresponding file name.output.

To perform the test:

invoke vaxima
(C1) loadfile("../gtload.l")$
(C2) batch("filename.v")$


There are some .l files that can be loaded into the lisp level
under Vaxima to test the lisp level calls to gentran.
