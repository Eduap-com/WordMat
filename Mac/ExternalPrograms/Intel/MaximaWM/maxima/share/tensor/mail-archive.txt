                Attention TENSOR users

There are plans to rewrite the tensor code this summer.  There are a number
of known difficulties with the ETENSR and ITENSR (or original CTMS and ITMS)
packs.  However, we would like to know who uses them and more important we
would appreciate any comments, criticisms, suggestions etc on improving
the ETENSR AND ITENSR code. If you have developed any special purpose routines
utilizing the code let us know this as well.  Further, please criticise the
description of these packages in the manual.  Send mail to TENSOR or
INFO-TENSOR if you wish to share your ideas.  Work on the tensor packs
will begin in early June.

The new tensor packages are operational. The ETENSR pack is now called
CTENSR and is available by doing

LOADFILE(CTENSR,FASL,SHARE); for component tensor manipulation.

The ITENSR pack, as before, is loaded by doing

LOADFILE(ITENSR,FASL,SHARE); for indicial tensor manipulation.

Both packages have many new  functions as well  as old ones which have
been modified. A full description is available by printing

SHARE;TENSOR DESCR.

In addition,  demos  exist  on the TENSOR  directory  under  the first
filenames CTENSR and ITENSR. Send bugs or comments to RP or TENSOR.

John Fitch, Michael Rothstein and I are writing an article on Computer
Algebra for Scientific American.  I am soliciting ideas about specific
items of interest we might include.

The proposal to Scientific American suggested the following topics:
1) a historical introduction to algebraic manipulation
2) a description of algorithm implementation and capabilities
3) the various programming languages and their advantages to specific
   systems
4) a description of some specific problems which have been solved. This
   would include some of the big problems which had been done by hand
   and have now been checked by computer with comments on the accuracy of
   scientists of that day.
5) the future of the field and comments on problems which may be solved
   (in the physical sciences for example).

The article must, of course, be directed to the educated layman. In addition,
no equations may appear in the text but we can put them in separate boxes.

Bearing in mind that the 5 topics above are not cast in stone, but there
are the two constraints, I would appreciate any suggestions and/or
comments.  Please reply to RP@MC. Thanks.

P.S. Please excuse the multiple copies some of you may receive because
of my choice of mailing lists.

Plans are being made to extend CTENSR to include interaction with LSH's
STENSR package. This will mean that a user in CTENSR may decide that
a 5dimensional array such as the covariant derivative of the Riemann
tensor is needed or perhaps a scalar constructed from the Riemann
tensor and its dual- whatever.  A new function in CTENSR will interact
with STENSR to allow construction of a large number of geometrical
objects.

We need some input and hence this note. We must have some idea
of the kinds of objects you may be interested in so we can build
a decent input function in CTENSR. Therefore, if you have some ideas
of the kinds of objects you may want to construct send mail to TENSOR@MC.

There is now a new version of CTENSR called TENSOR;CTENSR NFASL.
It runs about twice as fast as the old version, CTENSR FASL,
but may leave less work space for the user. This may not, however,
be apparent for standard problems.

I am asking users to test the new version and let me know how it
runs. If there are no core problems I will let this become the working
version with the fassave as the backup version. However, for the
present the old version will still be loaded by calling TSETUP()
in MACYSMA.

Thanks go to GJC for creating CTENSR NFASL.

I ran some tests on GJC'c newly translated and compiled version of CTENSR
comparing it to the FASLOAD which has been the standard. Both are about
the same size. GJC's looks very good for the 4 tests below. LHS's version
bombed out for the 4th demo but was equivalent to GJC's wrt time
and size for the other three. In view of these results I think
this version should replace the FASSAVE. I will wait a few days
and run some more tests. Any comments?

TRIGSUM(exp);   is a new function that exploits the trig sum-relation:
                 2         2
                          sin (x) + cos (x) -1  => 0

simultaneously in all formulations: sin+cos->1,  1-sin->cos,  1-cos->sin.
Each direction is selectively used only where it is BENEFICIAL, and
the program returns THAT mixture of sin and cos that constitutes the
least number of terms.      For instance:

TRIGSUM of: (ONE - C     )*SIN(X)^2   Returns     (      S)*SIN(X)^2
          + (ONE      - S)*COS(X)^2     ===>    + (    C  )*COS(X)^2
          + (    + C  + S)                      + (ONE    )

This works equally well and fast if multiplied with any sin-cos power.
The workspace consumption =0, in contrast to explicit subst. sin=>cos.
See the output file  LSH;TRGSUM DEMOUT   -which is a writefile
of  the batch        TRGSUM,DEMO

TRIGSUM calls the arbitrary-sum-substitutor (=1yr work) in STENSR (6y).
An attempt to explain it's main lines is in TRGSUM MAIL
(complementing Springer Verlag.. see lsh;STENSR INFO)

I've the last two months [besides beating RP's Sci. Am-problem on 4
machines] made long planned improvements of the sumsubstitutor as to:

1) Substitute COLLAPSABLE sums, ie sums for which the number of, and
   sequence of, the terms may change in certain malign environments.
   Eg. the cyclic sum of 3 Riemann tensors (=identically zero) can
   collapse to 2 or less terms if contracted with symmetric tensors.

2) allow a user-provided, optional ELECTION-function, that determines
   what terms to get rid of when that choice is extra tricky. A such
   one is built into TRIGSUM, doing the choice between the terms
   associated with  "sin", "cos" and "-1".

Let me know if you can repeat any demo example with trigsimp,ratsubst
,exponentialize..

TRIGSUM(exp);  is a new function (autoloading) that exploits the
TRIG-onometric SUM-relation:     2         2
                              sin (x) + cos (x) - 1  ==> 0

in an optimal fashion; ie it uses DIFFERENT formulations:
   2      2                   2        2             2        2
sin  + cos  ==> 1,     1 - sin  ==> cos ,     1 - cos  ==> sin

selectively only where they are BENEFICIAL, and the program returns
THAT mixture of sin and cos that constitutes the least number of terms.
For instance, TRIGSUM on the 6-term-expression:

  (ONE - C     )*SIN(X)^2 \  Returns 3 terms: /    (      S)*SIN(X)^2
+ (ONE      - S)*COS(X)^2  >      ===>       <   + (    C  )*COS(X)^2
+ (    + C  + S)          /                   \  + (ONE    )

This works equally well and fast if multiplied with any sin-cos power.

TRIGSUM uses the sum-substitutor (=1yr work) in STENSR. For references
and pointers see SHARE;STENSR USAGE.  Any arb.-length-sum of arb.-length-
products of tensors can be substituted, and in PRINCIPLE also of scalars.
Send bugs, and such sum-relations that you want to exploit, to me.

Being a complicated program, it's not small, but you can ALWAYS type
TRIGSUM(..);  since it tests space to fit the program before it autoloads.
Also the workspace consumption =0, in contrast to explicit subst. sin=>cos.

Do   :PRINT LSH;TRGSUM DEMOUT    to see a demo writefile, or run the demo
itself by  DEMO(TRGSUM,DEMO,DSK,LSH)$   which takes 5 cpu-min to end
[but (a curiosum): substituting sin=>cos would give results requiring
an Earthsized machine to store, and would take 10^7 Universe-lifetimes].

Then it also COMBINES BACK the sin- and cos-es into the most
advantageous combination of the other functions (not offered

    I have put CURVATURE alphabetically, which places it between COVDIFF
    and DIFF.  I myself wonder if (since there is an index) you might want
    to consider reordering the functions more by "use", if there is any
    sort of progression there... it is a very minor point, so if you don't
    care we will leave things as they are, but to me for instance it would
    seem natural to have DIFF and COVDIFF together, and have CURVATURE
    (even if it were named RIEMANN and thus came later in the alphabet) just
    before GEODESIC, since they appear (to my casual glance) to be related.
    Anyone needing the page of a precise function probably isn't going to
    be making use of the fact they are alphabetical, but rather using the
    index.
I do not think this would be useful here. Clearly, for a users manual it
is a winning idea.

No, that's a different bug.  The installed Macsyma doesn't know about
macsyma-module, so running interpreted system code won't work.  Try loading
the compiled file.

RE ITENSR... what is the proper file spec for the compiled version of

No, it is just called itensr.  If you do "cwd >udd>Mathlab>Macsyma>share"
(or just "cwd >udd>mal>a>share"), then you can type "list" to list the
contents of the directory.  (Of course this is less obvious than typing
control-F, but what can you do with a loser like Multics.)

---------------------------------
I edited a copy of each demo file here on MC and retransferred them to Multics.
Now, when I attempt to demo these files, they appear to work until (for
demo1, e.g.) up to the line

CANFORM(EXP);

at which point it gets an error:

lisp:function allfiles rejected argument ((dsk tensor) symtry fasl)

which I gather means we need to transfer (and compile) some more files.

I ran some more tests and the CTENSR demos run on MULTICS though
this example of Unruh's bombs. The problem occurs when ANY metric
is direct input (as opposed to the demos where the user does not
type them). I have no idea where the problem lies.

It seems to happen with any metric. MC is working fine if that helps.
We will try to do something but there is little support for MULTICS macsyma
as you may know.

   Yes, I am the William G Unruh who used to use MIT-MC, and I would love to
   use MC to do my calculations. My problem is that here I do not have access
   to ARPA NET and have been unable to find out how to get on to it from
   British Columbia. We are now on Datapac and I can therefore get onto
   Multics via TELENET. Its too expensive to phone MC (about $100/hr). If you
   have any sugestion as to how I could use MC I would love to hear it.

One possibility is to request ARPAnet access (or Chaos net access...
that is our local MIT net and I believe Multics is now connected to
it) to MC to go along with your Multics account and use MC from a
"supdup" connection from Multics.  The connection (being through
Telenet to Multics then through ARPA or Chaos net to MC) will probably
be somewhat "slow" and perhaps frustrating from the "user
input/output" point of view, but of course the Tensor package would
then work for you, and you could probably do any preparation of batch
files or whatever on Multics and only make use of an interactive port
to MC to do the actual calculation.  You would have to contact the
Information Processing Services to arrange this.  If they have any
questions about it, you can refer them to me.

   [1] why did  loadfile(etensr,fasl,dsk,share)
   not load as macsyma manual says it should? What do I do?
The manual was written before the current Multics Macsyma even existed.
On Multics you can get the package which is now called "ctensr" by doing:
    loadfile(">udd>Mathlab>macsyma>share>ctensr.lisp");

   [2] Following macsyma reference manual, p.191-192, I typed tsetup(),
   but only got the reply   tsetup()
   rather than what the manual shows.
On Multics you have to do the loadfile listed in [1] above before typing
tsetup();.

This mail archive contains old MIT MACSYMA mailing list messages that were

mostly of historical interest, but I found some of it educational, i.e.,
worth preserving. I sorted them chronologically, and modified message
headers so that the archive can now be read by any mail program that
understands UNIX format mail archives (i.e., mail -f mail-archive.txt
should suffice on any UNIX/Linux box.)

It is interesting to note that much of this code was written at a time when
people were still concerned about loading an extra few kilobytes worth of
code into system memory!
