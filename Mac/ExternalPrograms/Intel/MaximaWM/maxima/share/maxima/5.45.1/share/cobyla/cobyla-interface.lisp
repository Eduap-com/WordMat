 fmin_cobyla(f, vars, init_x, [args])

   f       Real function to be minimized
   vars    List of variables over which to minimize
   init_x  Initial guess.  Do NOT set to all zeroes.

 The optional arguments are all keyword arguments of the form key =
 value:

   constraints  List of expressions for the constraints on the variables.
                Each expression is assumed to be greater than or equal
                to zero.  Constraints must be of the form f >= g, f <=
                g, or f = g.
   rhobeg       Initial value of the internal RHO variable which controls 
                the size of simplex.  (Defaults to 1.)
   rhoend       The desired final value rho parameter.  It is approximately
                the accuracy in the variables. (Defaults to 1d-6.)
   iprint       Verbose output level.  (Defaults to 0.)
                0 - No output
                1 - Summary at the end of the calculation
		2 - Each new value of RHO and SIGMA is printed, including 
		    the vector of variables, some function information when 
		    RHO is reduced.
		3 - Like 2, but information is printed when F(X) is computed.
   maxfun       The maximum number of function evaluations.  (Defaults to
                1000).

 The parameter SIGMA is an internal penalty parameter, it being
 assumed that a change to X is an improvement if it reduces the merit
 function

            F(X)+SIGMA*MAX(0.0,-C1(X),-C2(X),...,-CM(X))

 where C1, C2 are the constraint functions.  When printed the
 parameter MAXCV is the MAX term above, which stands for MAXimum
 Constraint Violation.

 On return, a vector of four elements is given:

  1:  The value of the variables giving the minimum
  2:  The minimized function value
  3:  The number of function evaluations.
  4:  Success code:
        0 - success
        1 - maxfun limit reached
        2 - rounding issues
       -1 - maxcv exceeds rhoend probably indicating constraints not
            satisfied.

 You can find some examples in share/cobyla/ex.

 An example of minimizing x1*x2 with 1-x1^2-x2^2 >= 0:

   load(fmin_cobyla);
   fmin_cobyla(x1*x2, [x1, x2], [1,1], constraints = [1-x1^2-x2^2 >= 0], iprint=1);

 => [[x1 = 0.707107555323284, x2 = - 0.7071060070503778], 
          - 0.4999999999998015, 64, 0]

 The theoretical solution is x1 = 1/sqrt(2), x2 = -1/sqrt(2).
