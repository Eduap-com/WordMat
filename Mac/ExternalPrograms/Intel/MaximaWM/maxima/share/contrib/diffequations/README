The routines in this directory extend the ODE2 routines for the
solution of ordinary differential equations.  The file contrib_ode.usg
provides a brief introduction.

Before they can be used the *.mac files must be placed in the load
path.  One way to do this is to copy them into the installed
maxima/share/diffequations directory.
