maxima-odesolve is a collection of files for maxima that will help in solving linear and nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

The goal of the package is to provide the maxima user a collection of individual ODE analysis and solution algorithms that are easy to use and robust.

The contents of the package are currently:

kovacicODE.mac 
Solves linear second order ODEs that have Liouvillian solutions, using the Kovacic algorithm, modified by Saunders and based on the thesis of Carolyn Smith.
